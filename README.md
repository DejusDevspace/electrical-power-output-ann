Building and Training an Artificial Neural Network to predict full load electrical power output of a base load operated combined cycle power plant. 
The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository; <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant'>Combined Cycle Power Plant</a>.
I stumbled upon the intuition and implementation idea from <a href='https://www.superdatascience.com/'>SuperDataScience</a>.
